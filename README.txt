Overview
RoboNoKill is a simple 2d top down survival game where you need to dismantle all panels on the map while killer
robots are after you to win the level. The current state of the game is not quite what I envisioned. The collision
detection turned out to be a huge time suck, so I scratched it. The movement is wonky, and I was not able to implement
extra levels and other stuff. However, I learned a lot from this project and had fun! :D

Controls
WASD for the movement, E to fire a bolt in the direction you were last moving when you have one, L-CTRL while
playing to show the Dijkstra debugging numbers, ESC while playing to enter level select state.

Originally Proposed Low-bar Items
Tile Based Maps: At least 2 unique tile-based maps - Complete
Constrained Movement: Both the survivor and the robots are confined to the corridors indicated on the map - Complete
Pathfinding: The robots will be able to identify and pursue the survivor using Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm - Complete
Robot States: The robots will have different states they can go in and out of under differing circumstances - Complete
Collision detection: Entities will be able to tell if they collide with one another - Incomplete
Custom sprites and sounds: Fun sounds and visuals that enhance the game - Complete
Powerup: At least one powerup implemented - Complete

Other Goals
